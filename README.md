# About React Hooks

This project contains code examples on React Hooks, and Markdown (.md) files as guides, and **mainly focuses on the *`useEffect` Hook*, *functional component lifecycle*, and the *rules of Hooks***.

All information here is gathered from the [React website](https://reactjs.org/).

<br />

**NOTE**

One of the main motives here is to provide a supplement to the official documentation on React since the existing documentation (currently) on `useEffect` and on component lifecycle is unsatisfactory and even a little misleading.
